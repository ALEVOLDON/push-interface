Push Interface
==============

## What is Push?

[Push](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/) is a digital instrument to create and perform music. Push is engineered in-house at Ableton. The second iteration of the instrument - Push 2 was announced at [Loop](https://loop.ableton.com/) in November, 2015. You can see Push in combination with [Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CdMvkBOUgs).

## Interfacing with Push

In the [Ableton Push 2 MIDI and Display Interface Manual](doc/AbletonPush2MIDIDisplayInterface.asc) you can read about the instrument's hardware specification. This manual is of use to the people who want to create their own extensions or applications to the existing possible uses of Push. Both the MIDI and Display interfaces are elaboratively explained, and there is a list of commands provided that you can use to modify the default settings.
